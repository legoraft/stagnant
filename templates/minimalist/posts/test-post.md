This is a simple test post to show you how to format you posts. The section between the `---` is called _frontmatter_, you add your title, publication date and description of the post here. After this, you can just write your post in markdown.

## Markdown formatting

Markdown formatting is quite easy, it just uses text to do this. For example, `_italic_` will become _italic_ and `**bold**` will become **bold**. To check out all the markdown specs, take a look at the [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

You can also add some code blocks, either `inline` with `` `backticks` `` or a code block, which you define with three backticks. You can also specify a language like so:

````md
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
````
