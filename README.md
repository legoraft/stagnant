# Stagnant

Stagnant is a hackable static site generator. It allows you to create templates in the way that websites work by default: through HTML! The posts are written in markdown and can all be stored in a `posts` directory.

## Info
Stagnant is a simple hackable site generator, for which you can write you own templates in HTML. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/legoraft/stagnant/wiki/Creating-templates) for information about creating your own template.

## Usage
You can publish your site through github pages by making a repository with `username.github.io` as name that contains one of the [templates](https://github.com/legoraft/stagnant/releases/tag/templates). Just upload the files or folders to you repository and change the github pages setting to use actions instead of a branch. Take a look at the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow) for this.
