# Stagnant

Stagnant is a hackable static site generator. It allows you to create templates in the way that websites work by default: through HTML! The posts are written in markdown and can all be stored in a `posts` directory. You can publish your site through github pages by making a repository that contains a `posts` and `template` repository. Just add the [workflow](https://github.com/legoraft/legoraft.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/stagnant.yml) and start writing.
